# Nito Cash

> **TL;DR** To create a web-based, privacy centric wallet for on-boarding first-time crypto users, especially when time is a constraint.

**Benefits of a ephemeral wallet**

**On-boarding new users to crypto will usually involve the following:**

1. Visit your local App Store
2. Download whatever wallet app your sponsor recommends
3. Create a new wallet within the app
4. Write down the 12 words required to secure your new wallet
5. Confirm the 12 words to complete the setup process
6. Receive crypto from your sponsor

**On-boarding new users SHOULD involve the following:**

1. Open your mobile web browser
2. Type in an address (eg. [https://nito.cash](https://nito.cash))
3. Receive crypto from your sponsor

The time difference between the 2 processes is only a few minutes. however imho, a few minutes makes ALL the difference in the world.

**So what's the real world use-case?**

In my early days of crypto, I on-boarded multiple users on a daily basis, most commonly my Uber drivers. The process only took an average of 5 minutes. However, this time came at the END of the trip, since the driver would obviously be focused on .. DRIVING!

Nito Cash should only take about 30 seconds from the first mention, through receiving their first crypto. Nito Cash would then provide ALL the necessary education for the recipient, rather than having to overly burden the sponsor. (The sponsor would be free to talk about crypto during the entire ride however).

This example could be easily repeated in multiple situations (you're about to learn a bit about me here), for example:

1. A noisy bar/restaurant
2. A social event

**And what's wrong with just using an App Store wallet?**

Besides the time factor that I've already detailed above, there is another major problem, specifically with the countless wallets that DO NOT use the traditinoal username/password model. From my experience, users DO NOT properly store those 12 words. Edge wallet (formerly Airbitz) was my go-to for this exact reason.

However, in today's market, I just don't see this model widely used anymore. (with a few exceptions, the wallets that do employ this model are NOT wallets that I would recommend to anyone, eg. Coinbase -- you know exactly why, so don't ask)

The purpose of Nito Cash is to be an EPHEMERAL wallet, and NOT your daily driver. Its primary purpose is for on-boarding first-time users AND educating them on "How to do crypto correctly!". That's it!

The goal is to make Nito Cash not only a frictionless experience, but an enjoyable one.
